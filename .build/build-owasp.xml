            failBuildOnCVSS is by default 11 so build would never fail,
            the table categorising vulnerabilities is here, so by setting
            "failBuildOnCVSS" to 9, we will fail the build on case are is a critical
            vulnerability found.

            If a vendor provides no details about a vulnerability,
            NVD will score that vulnerability as a 10.0 (the highest rating).
